          <p> <strong>Title:</strong> Password Management System</p>
          <p> <strong>Description:</strong> Remembering a lot of passwords and accounts is a really hard challenge for me, so I want to create a app that can help me to store and easily access to the authentication pages that I need while only need to remember 1 master passwords.
          This project can help users to store passwords securely and can even recommend strong passwords in most cases. And all of these passwords can only be accessed via a master passwords that the user need to remember</p>

This project is about recommeding recipe for meals randomly or by search through specific category of meal in the database.
